## Why testing?

In June 2022 I decided to change my career path from accounting to IT. I finished postgraduate studies in Python programming. The study program covered automated testing with Selenium and Robot Framework. I liked them so much that I decided to become a tester. I even wrote automated tests as the final project.

## Experience:

In May 2023 I started my adventure with crowdtesting. I passed the entry test at Testbirds and completed all courses at the Bird School. In June I joined uTest. From June to August I took part in two initiatives organised by Cherry-IT - training project and collaborative testing (COLT 2/2023). I've been working as a Software Tester since October 2023. In my free time I am working on my own projects in the field of automated testing, I am taking part in crowdtesting projects and I am writing articles about software testing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@marta.rakowska91).
